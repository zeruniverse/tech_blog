I used to think there’s no need for me to write a technical blog. Because everything I need can be found in Internet. However, as time passes by, I found out that techniques/knowledge I use today are supposed to be used in the future (maybe just tomorrow). In this case, I have to search the Internet again since it’s hard for me to remember everything<!--more-->.

So there’re two reasons for me to write this blog:

+ Avoid collecting information twice
+ Help me remember things that are useful

I just decide to start my technical blog today. And (hopefully) I will keep the habit of writing down what I learn here in the future.
